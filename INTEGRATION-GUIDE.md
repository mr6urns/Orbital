# EXPLORE Game Integration Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **Simple 3-Step Integration**

### **Step 1: Copy Files**
Copy these 3 files to your other project:
```
public/explore-game.html
public/explore-game.js
src/components/CharacterCreation.tsx
src/components/CharacterPreview.tsx
```

### **Step 2: Add Character Creation**
Replace your explore button with:
```tsx
import CharacterCreation from './components/CharacterCreation';

// In your component:
<CharacterCreation />
```

### **Step 3: Done!**
The character creation will show, and the game will launch when "Start Exploring" is clicked.

## âœ… **What Makes This Clean:**
- **No dependencies** on your existing code
- **Self-contained** game files
- **Character data** automatically saved to localStorage
- **No modifications** to your existing files
- **Stable** - won't change when imported

## ðŸ”§ **Files Overview:**
- `CharacterCreation.tsx` - Full character creation system
- `CharacterPreview.tsx` - 3D character preview
- `explore-game.html` - Complete standalone game
- `explore-game.js` - Complete game engine with character loading

## ðŸš€ **Ready for seamless integration!**
